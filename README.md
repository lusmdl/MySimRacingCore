# Sim Racing Core Controller

Welcome to the Sim Racing Core Controller repository! This project focuses on programming an ATmega32u4 microcontroller to serve as the central processing unit for a high-performance sim racing setup. The controller is designed to manage steering, pedals, and other accessories, providing a seamless and immersive racing experience.

## Features

- 16 buttons
- X-Axis with FFB
- Accelerate-Axis
- Brake-Axis
- Rx-Axis
- Ry-Axis



## Getting Started



## Hardware Requirements

- **ATmega32u4 Microcontroller**: I used the original arduino micro board
- **Steering Wheel**: I used a cheap optical encoder with A and B line
- **Pedals**: I used a old Xbox360 racing Wheele pedal set. It only needs to work with potis.
- **Buttons**: I used 4 2x2 Matrixes

## Software Requirements

- [**Platform IO**](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode): Used for programming the ATmega32u4 microcontroller.
- [**Arduino Joystick With Force Feedback Library**](https://github.com/YukMingLaw/ArduinoJoystickWithFFBLibrary.git)
- [**Keypad Library**](https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad.git): Used for the 4x4 Matrix
