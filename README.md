# Sim Racing Core Controller

Welcome to the Sim Racing Core Controller repository! This project focuses on programming an ATmega32u4 microcontroller to serve as the central processing unit for a high-performance sim racing setup. The controller is designed to manage steering, pedals, and other accessories, providing a seamless and immersive racing experience.

## Features

- 16 buttons



## Getting Started



## Hardware Requirements

- **ATmega32u4 Microcontroller**: The core of the project, responsible for processing inputs and outputs.
- **Steering Wheel**: Connects to the microcontroller for precise steering control.
- **Pedals**: Throttle, brake, and clutch pedals integrated with the controller.
- **Additional Accessories**: Optional accessories like shifters, buttons, and displays.

## Software Requirements
